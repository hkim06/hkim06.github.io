- Interfaces are contracts that define how two systems should interact with one another. 
- APIs are special types of interfaces that define how two computer systems interact with one another coming in many forms, such as downloadable libraries and web APIs.
- Web APIs are special because they expose functionality over a network, hiding the specific implementation or computatioinal requirements needed for that functionality.
- Resource-oriented APIs are a way of designing APIs to reduce complexity by relying on a standard set of actions, called methods, across a limited set of things, called resources.
- What makes APIs "good" is a bit ambiguous, but generally good APIs are operational, expressive, simple, and predictable.
